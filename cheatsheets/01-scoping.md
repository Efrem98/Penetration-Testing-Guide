## 📍 Penetration Testing Guide

### 🔹 Phase 1 – Scoping and Preparation

This phase is the foundation of a successful penetration test. Even the most technically skilled test can fail if this stage is not handled correctly. A 20-year veteran hacker knows: get the rules, define the playground, and set your boundaries before touching a single packet.

### 🔸 Goals

* Clearly define what systems are in-scope
* Ensure legal authorization and reduce liability
* Establish clear communication with stakeholders
* Define success metrics and deliverables

### 🔸 Test Types

|Type|Access Level|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Black Box|None|Simulates an external attacker with no prior knowledge|
|Grey Box|Limited|Mimics an insider threat or attacker with limited access|
|White Box|Full|Simulates an internal audit with source code and full documentation|

➡️ Tip: Always clarify whether social engineering and physical intrusion are allowed. Don’t assume!

### 🔸 Tools for Managing the Engagement

* Notion / Obsidian: Track project phases, notes, client info
* XMind / draw.io: Mindmap attack surfaces and services
* Trello / Kanban boards: Organize test stages, assign tasks if team-based

### 🔸 Document Templates to Prepare

* rules-of-engagement.md: Define what’s allowed, when, how, and under which conditions
* report-template.md: Structure your report early, fill it gradually as you discover
